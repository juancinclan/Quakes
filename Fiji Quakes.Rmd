## Locations of Earthquakes of Fiji

The following Scatterplot uses the quakes data set from the datasets library in R. The data contains 5 columns that are the following:

1. lat=Latitude of the event
2. long=Longitude of the event
3. depth=Depth (km)
4. mag=Richter Magnitude
5. stations= Number of stations reporting

The plot has in the x axis de longitude and in the y axis the latitude. The colors are by the number of stations reporting and the size is the Richter magnitude of the event.

***
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 library(datasets)
library(plotly)

plot_ly(quakes, x = ~long, y = ~lat, type = "scatter",
color = ~factor(stations), size = ~mag)

```
